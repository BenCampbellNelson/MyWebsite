# RickandMorty site

created by Ben Campbell-Nelson (BenCampbellNelson on GitHub)

This website is the beginning of a fan site for rick and morty. So far it is the structure of a site with a function character guessing game implemented.

## Motivation

As a fan of rick and morty I became super interested with the API. I wanted to see if I could create a fan site and figure out how to make games with javascript and the API.

## Features

Charcter guessing game with hints, score system and and ability to skip to next character

Structured website with easy scalability


## Technologies

SvelteKit, a framework for building web based applications

HTML, CSS, and JavaScript


## Installation

Clone the repository

Navigate to the project directory: cd my-app

Install the dependencies: npm install

Start the development server: npm run dev -- --open


## Future

User accounts

I'd like to have functioning user accounts that users can log in with and keep track of their scores. I need to get a better understanding of user accounts and creating my own API's in intro app dev before I can begin that sort of thing.

More games

I'd like to create some more games, like trivia, or guess what episode this charcater first appeared in games like that

Flesh out site

 I'd like to keep adding to the information available on the site so users can feel like just by being on the site they can get better at the games.
